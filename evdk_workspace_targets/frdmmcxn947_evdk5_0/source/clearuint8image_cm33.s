  * Version V4.0
  * Date    09 October 2024
  * Brief   ARM Cortex-M33 assembler routine to set a byte sequence to 0.
  *         Assumptions:
  *             - aligned data
  *             - uint8_t image type
  *             - number of data bytes in the image is divisible by 32
  *
  *         ARM Cortex-M33 instruction set can be found here:
  *         https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100235/0100
  *
  *         Note: For using this function declare the following function
  *               prototype external in the project:
  *
  *               extern void clearuint8image_cm33(const image_t *img);
  *
  *         Example usage:
  *
  *               clearuint8image_cm33(img);

  * Version V1.0
  * Date    09 October 2024
  * Brief   ARM Cortex-M33 assembler routine to copy and convert a UYVY image
  *         to a uint8 image.
  *         Assumptions:
  *             - aligned data
  *             - number of bytes is divisible by 8
  *
  *         ARM Cortex-M33 instruction set can be found here:
  *         https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100235/0100
  *
  *         Note: For using this function declare the following function
  *               prototype external in the project:
  *
  *               extern void convertuyvytouint8_cm33(image_t *src, image_t *dst);
  *
  *         Example usage:
  *
  *               convertuyvytouint8_cm33(src, dst);
